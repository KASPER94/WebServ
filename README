### connect -- initiate a connection on a socket
```c++
int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
```
Connects the socket `sockfd` to the address specified by `addr`.

### inet_addr -- IPv4 address manipulation

```c++
#include <arpa/inet.h>

in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);
```
converts the string `cp` to an integer value suitable for use as an Internet address.

### setsockopt -- set the socket 

```c++
int setsockopt(int sockfd, int level, int option_name, const void *option_value, socklen_t option_len);
```
sets the option `option_name` argument, at the protocol level specified by the `level` argument, to the value `option_value` for the socket `sockfd`.

### fcnt -- manipulate file descriptor

```c++
#include <fcntl.h>

int fcntl(int fd, int cmd, ... /* arg */ );
```
performs one of the operation `cmd` on the open file descriptor `fd`.

## HTTP requests methods

HTTP defines a set of request methods(or *verbs*) to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.

The HTTP/1.0 specification defined the GET, HEAD, and POST methods, and the HTTP/1.1 specification added five new methods: PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE.

- `GET` = requests that the target resource transfer a representation of its state (**HTTP status codes**). Requests using GET should only retrieve data without making changes.
- `HEAD` = asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body (only the header). 
- `POST` = submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
- `PUT` = requests that the target resource create or update its state with the state defined by the submitted request. A distinction from POST is that the client specifies the target location on the server.
- `DELETE` = deletes the specified resource.
- `CONNECT` =  establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.(?)
- `OPTIONS` =  requests that the target resource transfer the HTTP methods that it supports. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting '*' instead of a specific resource.
- `TRACE` =  requests that the target resource transfer the received request in the response body. That way a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediaries.
- `PATCH` = applies partial modifications to a resource.

Host: www.example.com

## HTTP/1.1 response
A response message is sent by a server to a client as a reply to its former request message. They define how information sent/received, the session verification and identification of the client (cookies, IP, user-agent) or their anonymity (VPN or proxy), how the server should handle data (Do-Not-Track)...
